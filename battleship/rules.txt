1. There are a number of ships that span the map
either vertically or horizontally. The goal is to
hit them and sink them all. When all ships have 
been sunk, the game ends.

2. When a player hits a ship, they receive a set 
amount of points, depending on which ship is hit.
-----Miss (blue) - 0 pts
-----Carrier (length 5, red) - 10 pts
-----Battleship (length 4, yellow) - 15 pts
-----Submarine (length 3, green) - 25 pts
-----Destroyer (length 2, white) - 30 pts
-----Sunk Bonus: 2x (Last part of the ship is hit)

3. You may choose two scoring systems: one where both
players get the same amount of points, the other where
player 2 has 5 pts bonus for EACH hit.

4. You may generate a random map or use your specified map
by loading a file with a specific format.
